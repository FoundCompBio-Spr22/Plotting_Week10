## Introduction

`Matplotlib` is a Python module that's commonly used for plotting. There are different ways to interact with `matplotlib`, but we'll be relying on the `pyplot` submodule. To import this module, it's helpful to give it a shorter "nickname"

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

When a module (or submodule) is imported with the `as` keyword, it gives us a different (hopefully shorter) name with which to reference it.

Another module that's commonly used when analyzing and plotting data is `numpy`

`import numpy as np`
